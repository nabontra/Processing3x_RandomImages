# Processing 3.x - Random Image Arrangement
A sketch which reads images from a folder and then randomly places them in a pile.  You can press R to find an arrangement you like, and then S to save it in the sketch folder.

It currently saves one generation in the sketch folder.  It will overwrite the previous file, so rename the PNG if you like it.
